- The roller coaster is created with Catmull Rom spline and the track is made to extend out along the path of spline
- The camera is also made to follow along the spline

## Features
- Spline
  - Used Catmull Rom splines
  - Used Recursive subdivision algorithm for splines
  - Used Sloan method for generating Spline normals
- Phong shading
  - Ambient lighting
  - Diffused lighting
  - Specular lighting
- Physically based dynamic camera movement along the roller coaster
- Phong shading to the ground with Normal maps using Tangent, Binormal, Normal space transformations
- Skybox
- Back face culling
- Anti-aliasing
